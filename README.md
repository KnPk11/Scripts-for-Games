## CS1.6 (Counter-Strike) AFK Bot
This script works best on 'GunGame' gamemode.

It allows you to play the game while being AFK by automatically walking/turning/strafing/jumping in random directions, as well as shooting (at enemies, provided you pair it with an aimbot).

* Please don't run it on the steam version of the game to avoid getting your account banned.
* Also I advice you tune down your aimbot to make it more realistic (so you don't headshot left and right), by switching on recoil, spread, switch off firing through walls.

Once ready fire up the script using AHK, join a server, sit back and watch how long it'll take everyone to realise/ban you...or tune the aimbot all the way down to make the player dumb and join the opposing team from another PC to gain an advantage!
